Self-Documenting Cryptography was developed in response to the pandemic of dishonesty and openly criminal conduct that has manifested here in the United States of America. This is currently exemplified by Donald Trump, Rupert Murdoch, Louis DeJoy, Betsy DeVos, Clarence Thomas, and so very many others both known and unknown.

For this reason, I dedicate the initial commit of Self-Documenting Cryptography to a friend of a friend, Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was recently sentenced to 25 years in a Russian prison for publicly speaking out against Vladimir Putin's war in the Ukraine.

Vlad is a childhood friend of my high school classmate Yuri Goldfeld. I had Yuri's father, Dr. Michael Goldfeld, for general chemistry my junior year of high school at the Indiana Academy for Science, Mathematics, and the Humanities on the campus of Ball State University. My senior year, I assisted Dr. Goldfeld in preparing for his gen chem labs. I found the advice of the inimitable Dr. Goldfeld to be far superior to the advice offered by the graduate lab assistant that helped supervise my gen chem labs at Case Western Reserve University.

Yuri and I share a deep intellectual commitment to computer science. We traveled together as part of a larger team to the University of Evansville to participate in programming contests. We both suffered through Dr. Doiron's optics class our senior year.

At the time, I felt that class was way too much on top of an already very challenging semester. In retrospect, optics was an unexpected introduction to signals and communication. As such, I ended up learning and using far more from optics than any other class I took that semester, even though I haven't done much more with visible light since. Dr. Doiron's optics played a significant role in preparing my mind for the invention of self-documenting cryptography, so it is indeed a happy coincidence that Yuri and I were in that class together.

Our senior year, Yuri participated in hijinks involving a counterintelligence answering machine owned and operated by the US Government.  This brought about a visitation by FBI agents to the Indiana Academy.  Yuri and five or six other Academites all got grounded for a month, and were required to individually write their own personal letter of apology to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Sadly, the zeitgeist has turned rather more sinister in both Russia and the United States over the intervening decades. In particular, this author has had a life-long front-row seat to the moral decline of the United States of America as instigated by self-indicting, morally bankrupt right-wing religions, media, and the Republican Party.

My first childhood memory that directly involved the politics of civil governance is a mock election between Bush and Dukakis that my elementary school held on November 8, 1988. I was eight years old and I was tentatively planning on casting a mock vote for Michael Dukakis, but the boys in my third grade class were adamant that he wanted to execute all the people who had AIDS, including Ryan White.

I didn't think that was too cool, so I trundled up to the Apple IIe and cast my mock vote for George Bush and Dan Quayle, who won our school's mock election in a blowout. I went home and watched the actual results unfold on TV. By the time I went to bed, I had figured out that I had been fooled. I learned two things that day: firstly, that republicans will enthusiastically tell the most vile lies about democrats. Secondly, republicans were a majority in my school who were deeply invested in intimidating minority points of view.

My mother was briefly acquainted with Hobart Freeman as a pastor in the late 1960s before they fell out. He continued on to become a highly notorious faith healer with an obituary in the New York Times. Though he died of eminently treatable medical conditions when I was just a tot, the legacy of Hobart Freeman continues to echo and reverberate in my local area.

Extremism in the defense of stupidity is no virtue. The universe doesn't care about your feelings. Its physical laws operate under principles of strict liability. With those disclaimers in mind, Hobart Freeman does appear to have been consistent in his beliefs. This is frequently untrue inside Rupert Murdoch's empire of lies.

Fox News required COVID-19 vaccines for employees while stridently promoting all manner of COVID-19 denialism on air. Rupert has a global reach whereas Hobart never did, greatly amplifying the magnitude of the damage.  Otherwise, the _actus rea_, or "guilty act", is similar, and the strict liabilities imposed by our unfeeling universe are broadly comparable.

Feelings matter! People do very much care about other people's feelings. This fact is extensively documented throughout history. For example, the western legal tradition takes into account _mens rea_, or the "guilty mind". Hobart Freeman's consistency does suggest more delusion than malevolence, at least on the topic of faith healing. By contrast, there is something tangibly more vile about Rupert Murdoch's firehose of bullshit.

Our continuing failure to effectively respond to the disinformation campaigns waged against the public of the United States and other western nations has many consequences. One of those is a large number of actual crimes are going unanswered, because those crimes are either unnoticed or are being ignored.

I have personally been blackmailed by an individual who loves to read the crowd and try to get out in front of it, and has no shame in telling the most utterly ridiculous lies. He anticipated what the neofascists are going to do, and then did it first. There is substantial overlap between my blackmailer, the once and former president, and Edward Wuncler III.

Of course, there's also many differences among these three examples. For instance, one is a fictional cartoon character, and the other two are real men who prefer to live inside their own cartoon fantasies. Ed Wuncler is profoundly unintelligent across all axes, Donald Trump is highly intelligent along a singular axis, and my blackmailer is intelligent in that and several other more conventional senses. All are thoroughly self-oblivious, needlessly bellicose, and intensely unwise. All openly exhibit flagrantly criminal behavior.

My work on self-documenting cryptography is a monument to the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder I experience as a result of having been blackmailed. I offer these insights as a metaphorical pair of R-360 Neptune guided explosive projectiles targeted at some of the lies that can be told by IT professionals, computer criminals, and state intelligence agencies.

These particular forms of dishonesty are certainly not my ultimate target.  However, those lies are what is within striking distance at the moment. They occupy territory that is strategically relevant to constructing better foundations upon which to build future cybersecurity efforts.

"Adin Ballou says: 'One man may not kill. If he kills a fellow-creature, he is a murderer. If two, ten, a hundred men do so, they, too, are murderers. But a government or a nation may kill as many men as it chooses, and that will not be murder, but a great and noble action. Only gather the people together on a large scale, and a battle of ten thousand men becomes an innocent action. But precisely how many people must there be to make it so? - that is the question. One man cannot plunder and pillage, but a whole nation can. But precisely how many are needed to make it permissible?'"

- Leo Tolstoy, The Kingdom of God Is Within You, 1894

"Even as we feel guilty about doing the things we know we ought not to do, and strive to do more of the good we want to do, our very worst sins are almost always things we know to be our Christian duty. Over and over, Christians support and participate in atrocious evil, not because we choose to do wrong, but because we think weâ€™re doing the right thing - the righteous thing, even."

- Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove, Reconstructing the Gospel, 2018
